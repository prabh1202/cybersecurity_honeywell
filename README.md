# Detailed Notes on Reliable Networks: Network Architecture

## Network Segmentation

### Broadcast Domains
- **Definition**: A broadcast domain is a network segment in which if one device sends a broadcast frame, all the devices in the same segment receive it.
- **Purpose**: Segmentation of a network into smaller broadcast domains reduces unnecessary traffic and improves network efficiency.
- **Implementation**: Routers are commonly used to define and separate broadcast domains.

### Routers as Boundaries
- **Function**: Routers operate at Layer 3 of the OSI model and serve as boundaries between different networks. They prevent broadcast traffic from one network from spilling into another, thus controlling network congestion and improving security.

## IP Addressing

### IPv4 and IPv6

#### IPv4 Addressing
- **Format**: IPv4 uses a 32-bit address divided into four octets (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
- **Subnetting**: Subnet masks (e.g., 255.255.255.0) are used to divide the IP address into network and host portions.

#### IPv6 Addressing
- **Format**: IPv6 uses a 128-bit address written as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).
- **Hexadecimal Representation**: Each "x" in the address represents a 16-bit block.
  
#### IPv6 Formatting Rules
- **Omit Leading Zeros**: Leading zeros within a block can be omitted (e.g., `0001` can be written as `1`).
- **Double Colon (::)**: Consecutive sections of zeros can be replaced with a double colon (e.g., `2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:0000:1428:57ab` can be shortened to `2001:0db8::1428:57ab`).
  
### IPv4 and IPv6 Coexistence

#### Tunneling
- **Definition**: Tunneling allows IPv6 packets to be encapsulated within IPv4 packets to travel across an IPv4 network.
- **Types**: Common methods include 6to4, Teredo, and ISATAP.

#### Translation
- **Definition**: Network Address Translation (NAT) can be used to translate between IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
- **Purpose**: This facilitates communication between IPv4-only and IPv6-only devices.

## DHCP Configuration

### Static and Dynamic Addressing
- **Static Addressing**: IP addresses are manually assigned to each device on the network, ensuring consistent addresses.
- **Dynamic Addressing**: DHCP servers automatically assign IP addresses to devices, simplifying management and reducing human error.

### DHCP Operation
- **DHCP Discover**: The client broadcasts a DHCP Discover message to find available DHCP servers.
- **DHCP Offer**: DHCP servers respond with an offer containing an available IP address.
- **DHCP Request**: The client requests the IP address from one of the offering servers.
- **DHCP Acknowledge**: The server acknowledges and assigns the IP address to the client, completing the process.

### DHCP Message Exchange
- **Discover**: The initial broadcast by the client to locate DHCP servers.
- **Offer**: The server’s response with an available IP address.
- **Request**: The client's formal request to use the offered address.
- **Acknowledge**: The server’s confirmation of the address assignment.

## Network Address Translation (NAT)

### Overview
- **Function**: NAT modifies the IP addresses in packet headers while they are in transit across a router, allowing multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address.
- **Types**:
  - **Static NAT**: One-to-one mapping between a local and public IP address.
  - **Dynamic NAT**: Maps an unregistered IP address to a registered IP address from a pool.
  - **PAT (Port Address Translation)**: Multiple local IP addresses are mapped to a single public IP address with different ports.

### NAT on Wireless Routers
- **Practical Example**: Using tools like Packet Tracer, you can examine how NAT is configured on a wireless router and how it translates IP addresses for internet access.

## TCP vs UDP

### Comparison
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**:
  - **Reliability**: Ensures reliable data transfer with error checking, acknowledgment, and retransmission.
  - **Connection-oriented**: Establishes a connection before data transfer begins.
  - **Use Cases**: Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS), email (SMTP), file transfer (FTP).

- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**:
  - **Speed**: Faster than TCP as it lacks the overhead of error-checking and retransmission.
  - **Connectionless**: Sends packets without establishing a connection.
  - **Use Cases**: Streaming media, online gaming, VoIP.

### Port Numbers and Socket Pairs
- **Port Numbers**: Ports identify specific processes or services within a host. For example, HTTP typically uses port 80.
- **Socket Pairs**: A combination of an IP address and a port number, used to establish a connection between two devices.

### The NETSTAT Command
- **Usage**: `NETSTAT` is a network utility that displays active connections, routing tables, and network interface statistics. It's useful for diagnosing network issues and monitoring connections.

## Network Application Services

### Common Network Application Services
- **Web Clients and Servers**:
  - **HTTP/HTTPS**: HTTP is the protocol for transmitting web pages, while HTTPS provides secure transmission through encryption.
  - **FTP**: File Transfer Protocol allows for the transfer of files between a client and a server.
  
### Client and Server Interaction
- **Process**: Clients request services from servers, which then respond to these requests. For example, a web browser (client) sends a request to a web server, which responds with the requested web page.

### Network Boundaries
- **Definition**: Boundaries define the limits of network segments or domains, often established by routers.
- **Security**: Implementing boundaries helps contain broadcast domains and enforce security policies, controlling access between different parts of the network.
